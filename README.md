# hi, i’m Corbin 👋✨

🌱 developer • curious learner • project tinkerer  
📍 Raleigh, NC  

I’m a software developer who loves learning by building things — from work projects to little side experiments that start with *“what if…?”* and end with *“oh, that’s how that works!”*  

I enjoy experimenting with code, solving problems, and slowly getting better one commit at a time 💻🌸

## 🧸 what i’m up to
- 📚 working on revising school projects & assignments  
- 🛠️ building small experiments and side projects  
- 🧠 learning new concepts by breaking things (and fixing them!)
- 🫧 putting all those hours in school to use

---

## ✨ tools & languages
- 🐍 Python  
- ⚙️ C++
- ✨ Qt
- 🎮 GDScript  
- 📄 TeX
  
*(and always learning more!)*

## 🌸 fun facts
- i believe progress > perfection  
- i love clean code… eventually
- the best feeling is seeing how far i’ve come

## 💫 little reminder
> *“debugging is just boss fights in disguise.”*
